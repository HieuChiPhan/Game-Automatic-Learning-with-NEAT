# Game-Automatic-Learning-with-NEAT
In this project, a simple game is created and learn to play automatically with Neutral Network with NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies.
Journal artical for NEAT can be found <a href="http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf">here</a>. 

## The Game

Very simple rule, the rock (blue) object falling down 

Duty of the player (red) is to avoid colliding with the rock. 

Player can only move vertically. 

Width of the rock changes.

For NEAT training, if point reach 500, the program stop for time saving.

Interface of the game as shown below:
